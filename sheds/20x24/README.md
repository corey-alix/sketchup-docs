* site-plan permit preceeds building permit
* [building permit application](http://www.greenvillesc.gov/FormCenter/Building-Permits-19/Eform-Building-Permit-Application-attach-237#_=_), requires cost estimate, tax map, zoning designation, overlay district.
* Use [gcgis](https://www.gcgis.org/apps/greenvillejs/) to find tax map #
* Use [zoning classifications](https://www.greenvillecounty.org/gcpc/pdf/zoning_classification.pdf) to find zoning designation (R-R1 for one acre residential).
* I used the map "Land Use" number for the "Overlay District" (mine was 1100, Residential Single Family)
* NOTE: If adding sewer need a [Service Lateral Fillable Form](http://www.greenvillesc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6296/Service-Lateral-Fillable-Form-PDF)
* Requires a [Lot Coverage Chart](http://www.greenvillesc.gov/DocumentCenter/View/7329/LOT-COVERAGE-CHART-PDF?bidId=) except for S-1 districts.  For a shed I think only the "Accessory structure" section is necessary.
